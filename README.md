# 2025 Bootcamp Final Assignment

You'll find your assignments in the exercises directory. To work on this assignment and submit your work, you can follow the instructions outlined below:
- Fork this repository
- Clone your fork of the repository and work on each of the provided notebooks for each exercise.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Submit a pull request (PR) to this repository from that fork with your solutions. Name the PR "<last_name>, <first_name> Solutions". For instance, "Cruz, Roy Solutions"

The process can be iterative, you can submit a first PR and then improve on the solution. If you're still working on your solution make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). To let us know to review your solution, mark it as ready. If there are any notes you would like to communicate to the reviewers, add them as comments in your PR.

***You will have 2 weeks from the end of the training period to complete the exercises.***
