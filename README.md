You'll find your assignments in the exercises directory.
- Fork this repository,
- Create a new folder from the root of the repository using your name (e.g. FirstLast using your first and last name),
- Write your solution for the exercises and

The process can be iterative, you can submit a first PR and then improve on the solution.
If you're still working on your solution make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). To let us know to review your solution, mark it as ready.
